# AI Model Comparison for Coding

This reference provides a detailed comparison of AI models suitable for coding assistance through Roo Code. Use this guide to select the optimal model for your specific development needs.

## Primary Models

### Gemini 2.5 Pro

**Context Window**: 1,000,000 tokens  
**Best Used For**: General coding, long development sessions, complex projects  
**Cost Efficiency**: ★★★★★ (Excellent)  
**Response Speed**: ★★★★☆ (Very Good)  

**Strengths**:
- Massive context window for complex projects
- Strong code generation capabilities
- Excellent cost-to-performance ratio
- Good understanding of various programming languages
- Handles large codebases well due to context size

**Limitations**:
- Reasoning can be less nuanced than Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- May occasionally be more verbose in explanations
- Less precise with extremely specific language requirements

**Code Example Quality**:
```python
# Gemini 2.5 Pro generates well-structured code with comments
def calculate_fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
    """
    Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
        
    Returns:
        A list containing the Fibonacci sequence
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    
    # Handle special cases
    if n == 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    # Initialize the sequence with the first two numbers
    fibonacci = [0, 1]
    
    # Generate the remaining numbers
    for i in range(2, n):
        fibonacci.append(fibonacci[i-1] + fibonacci[i-2])
        
    return fibonacci
```

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "rooCode.defaultModel": "gemini-2.5-pro",
  "rooCode.models.gemini-2.5-pro": {
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "topP": 0.95,

    """
    Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number is the sum
    of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
        
    Returns:
        A list containing the Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative")
    
    # Handle base cases
    if n == 0:
        return []
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    # Initialize with first two Fibonacci numbers
    sequence = [0, 1]
    
    # Generate remaining numbers in the sequence
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    
    return sequence
```

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "rooCode.models.claude-3.7-sonnet": {

## Future Model Developments

### Expected Updates

- **Gemini 3.0**: Expected to improve reasoning capabilities while maintaining large context window
- **Claude 4.0**: Rumored to significantly increase context window size while improving performance
- **GitHub Copilot 2.0**: Likely to include better project-wide awareness and reasoning

### Migration Considerations

When new model versions become available:
1. Test with non-critical projects first
2. Compare quality, performance, and cost metrics
3. Update your configuration gradually
4. Maintain fallback options during transition periods
