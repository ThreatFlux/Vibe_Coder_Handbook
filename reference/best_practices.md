# AI-Assisted Development Best Practices

This guide outlines recommended practices for integrating AI coding assistants into your development workflow efficiently and effectively.

## General Principles

### 1. Clearly Define the Problem

- **Be specific**: Before asking for assistance, clearly define the problem or feature
- **Provide context**: Explain relevant project details and constraints
- **Set expectations**: Specify the desired outcome and requirements

### 2. Maintain Control and Responsibility

- **Review all generated code**: Never use AI-generated code without understanding it
- **Own the architecture**: Make major architectural decisions yourself
- **Maintain security awareness**: Verify security considerations in generated code

### 3. Iterative Refinement

- **Start simple**: Begin with a basic implementation and refine iteratively
- **Give feedback**: Provide feedback on what works and what doesn't
- **Build incrementally**: Add features and complexity one step at a time

## Coding Workflow Integration

### Preparing Your Project

1. **Document project structure**:
   - Create a clear `README.md` and architecture documents
   - Define coding standards and patterns
   - Map key relationships between components

2. **Initialize project context**:
   - Run "Roo Code: Initialize Project Context" to scan important files
   - Manually highlight architectural decisions and patterns
   - Define key technical terms specific to your project

3. **Configure model preferences**:
   - Select appropriate models for different tasks
   - Configure memory management settings
   - Set up appropriate API keys and permissions

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Start of day**:
   - Run "Roo Code: Update Project Context" to incorporate recent changes
   - Review memory bank status to verify project understanding
   - Consider switching to appropriate models for planned tasks

2. **Feature development**:
   - Begin with planning using Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking
   - Switch to Gemini 2.5 Pro for implementation
   - Use "explain this code" prompts to verify understanding

3. **Code review and refinement**:
   - Request AI review of your code before committing
   - Ask for specific improvements and optimizations
   - Use "Roo Code: Generate Tests" for test coverage

4. **Debugging assistance**:
   - Provide error messages and context
   - Ask for explanations of unexpected behavior
   - Request targeted debugging approaches

5. **End of day**:
   - Update project context with significant changes
   - Document any important decisions or patterns discovered
   - Consider backing up valuable memory contexts

## Effective Prompting

### Prompt Structure

1. **Context**: Start with relevant background information
2. **Objective**: Clearly state what you want to achieve
3. **Constraints**: Specify any limitations or requirements
4. **Format**: Indicate desired response format

Example:
```
Context: I'm working on a FastAPI application with SQLAlchemy.
Objective: I need to implement pagination for the GET /users endpoint.
Constraints: 
- Must be compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0
- Should follow REST best practices
- Need to handle filtering and sorting as well
Format: Please provide the route implementation with detailed comments.
```

### Follow-up Practices

1. **Iterative refinement**:
   - "This looks good, but can we optimize the database query?"
   - "I like the approach, can we add error handling for X case?"

2. **Learning-focused follow-ups**:
   - "Can you explain why you chose this approach?"
   - "What are the trade-offs compared to alternative solutions?"

3. **Targeted adjustments**:
   - "The solution works, but can we refactor it to use async/await?"
   - "This follows our patterns, but we need to add logging according to our standards."

## Model Selection Strategy

### Best Practices by Task

| Task Type | Recommended Model | Alternative | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| Project planning | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Use thinking mode for complex planning |
| Architecture design | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Reasoning capabilities important here |
| Implementation | Gemini 2.5 Pro | GitHub Copilot | Large context window helps implementation |
| Code explanation | Either | - | Both models excel at explanations |
| Debugging | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Better reasoning through complex bugs |
| Documentation | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Context window helps with comprehensive docs |
| Refactoring | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Better for larger code changes |
| Testing | Gemini 2.5 Pro | GitHub Copilot | Good at understanding test requirements |
| Code review | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Reasoning helps identify potential issues |

### Task-Specific Settings

1. **For complex reasoning tasks**:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "claude-3.7-sonnet",
     "temperature": 0.2,
     "thinking": true
   }
   ```

2. **For code implementation**:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
     "temperature": 0.7,
     "contextStrategy": "code-focused"
   }
   ```

3. **For documentation**:
   ```json
   {
     "model": "gemini-2.5-pro",
     "temperature": 0.5,
     "maxTokens": 8192,
     "contextStrategy": "balanced"
   }
   ```

## Memory Management Best Practices

### Project Context Optimization

1. **Prioritize key files**:
   - Main architecture documents
   - Core model definitions
   - Interface definitions
   - Configuration files
   - Important readme files

2. **Excluded files**:
   - Generated code
   - Binary files
   - Temporary files
   - Large data files
   - Third-party libraries

3. **Refreshing strategies**:
   - After significant refactoring
   - When starting new components
   - When changing project direction
   - After merging major features

### Memory Bank Maintenance

1. **Regular cleanup**:
