# Vibe Coder Handbook

> The comprehensive guide to enhancing your development workflow with AI coding assistants.

## Introduction

The Vibe Coder Handbook provides developers with methodologies, best practices, and configuration guides for integrating AI coding assistants into their development workflow. This handbook focuses specifically on leveraging Roo Code with modern AI models to accelerate development, improve code quality, and enhance developer productivity.

## Key Features

- Complete setup and configuration guides for Roo Code
- Model selection strategies to optimize for performance and cost
- Memory management techniques for extended context retention
- Integration with VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and other development tools
- Best practices for prompting and system instructions
- Project management workflow integration with Makefiles
- Troubleshooting common issues and limitations

## Getting Started

To begin using this handbook, we recommend starting with the following sections:

1. [Getting Started](guides/getting_started.md) - Initial setup and configuration
2. [Roo Code Setup](guides/roo_code_setup.md) - Detailed installation instructions
3. [Model Selection](guides/model_selection.md) - Choosing the right model for your needs
4. [Google Cloud Vertex AI Setup](guides/vertex_ai_setup.md) - Setting up Vertex AI with JSON credentials
5. [MCP Servers](guides/mcp_servers.md) - Extending AI capabilities with Model Context Protocol
6. [GitHub Pages Deployment](guides/github_pages_deployment.md) - Publishing your handbook as a website

## Model Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: Gemini 2.5 Pro

Gemini 2.5 Pro is currently our recommended model for most development tasks due to:
- Excellent cost-to-performance ratio
- Massive 1 million token context window
- Strong code generation and understanding capabilities
- Efficient token usage for lengthy coding sessions
- Less need for a memory bank

### Alternative: Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking mode is excellent for:
- Complex architectural reasoning
- Deep code analysis tasks
- Nuanced programming challenges
- Needs a memory bank for extended context retention

However, it comes with:
- More limited context window than Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Higher cost per token
- May require more careful context management

## VS Code Integration

This handbook provides comprehensive guidance on integrating Roo Code with VS Code, including:
- Installation and configuration steps
- GitHub Copilot integration
- Keyboard shortcuts and commands
- Extension settings optimization

For detailed instructions, see [VS Code Integration](guides/vs_code_integration.md).

## Project Management

The handbook includes example Makefiles and project management templates to help standardize workflows:
- Code quality checks
- Testing automation
- Build processes
- Deployment pipelines

For a complete reference, see [Makefile Commands](reference/makefile_commands.md).
